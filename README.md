# WebExtension Event interface implementation

This module provides a convenient way for API implementors to provide Events that conform with the WebExtension [`Event` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/events/Event):

> An [interface] which allows the addition and removal of listeners for an [...] event

For now, please refer to the documentation of `setEvent` in `event.ts` ([local](./event.ts) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/web-ext-event/blob/master/event.ts)).
The event consumer API is stable, the implementor API is still subject to change.
